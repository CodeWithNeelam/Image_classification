This project focuses on image classification using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to identify and categorize images into predefined classes by analyzing their visual features. Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) are used to automatically extract features and improve accuracy. The system can be applied in areas like object recognition, medical imaging, and automated inspection.

How It Works

Input Image → The image is fed into a trained model.

Feature Extraction → The model identifies important patterns (edges, textures, shapes, colors, etc.).

Classification → The extracted features are passed through layers that assign probabilities to possible classes.

Prediction → The class with the highest probability is chosen as the final label.

Example

If you train a CNN on a dataset with images of animals (dogs, cats, birds), the model learns to differentiate their features.

Input: a new unseen image

Output:

Dog → 0.05

Cat → 0.90

Bird → 0.05
Predicted Class: Cat
